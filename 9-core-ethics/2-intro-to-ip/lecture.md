# Introduction to Intellectual Property (IP)

Intellectual property is intangible property that arises out of mental labor. It encompasses inventions, designs and artistic work. Federal and state laws give certain rights and protections to those who develop creative works to exclusively control intangible assets in the form of:

## Copyrights

A creative work that is fixed in a tangible medium usually qualifies for copyright protection.
Copyright is automatically created, however these need to be registered for suing for any damages or liabilities. Length of a copyright is life of author + 70 or 95 or 120 years. Practically perpetual. 

## Patents

You can apply for a patent if you have invented a product or process that is novel and non-obvious.
After a patent expires after 20 years, it becomes public property.

## Trademarks

A trademark is used to distinguish a product or service from competing products or services.

## Trade Secrets

A trade secret involves confidential information that gives a business a competitive edge.
