# Restful Web Services

REST (Representational State Transfer)
It has following constraints.

* Client Server architecture
* Layered System
* Interaction must be stateless. Each request must be independent of each other.
* Clients can cache.
* Uniform Interface of communication between client and server.

## Service Oriented Architecture

SOA provides principles to guide developers to break down the functionality of their monolithic enterprises into
smaller more manageable, modular services. These services are loosely coupled and strictly encapsulated.

## Microservices

Microservices can be thought of as a variation of SOA applied on an application scale.
