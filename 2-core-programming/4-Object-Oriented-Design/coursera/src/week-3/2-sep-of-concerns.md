# Separation of Concerns

One of the goals of design principles is help us to create software which is:

* Flexible
* Reusable
* Maintainable

## Concern

A concern is a very general notion, basically it is anything that matters in providing a solution to a problem.

Separation of concerns helps with more cohesive classes using OOPS concepts

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Decomposition
* Generalization
