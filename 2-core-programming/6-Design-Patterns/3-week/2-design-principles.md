# Design Principles

## S:Single Responsibility Principle

Don't put functions that change for different reasons in the same class.

## O:Open/Closed principle

Module or class should be open for extension but closed for modification. (Factor out the commonality, DRY)
If this principle is implemented, then new features can be added without changing existing code.

## L:Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes must be usable through the base class interface, without the need for the user to know
the difference.

## I:Interface Segregation Principle

## D:Dependency Inversion Principle
