Macbeth

“Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.” 

"By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes."

"If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not."



"Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.”
