# Missing Semester

This lecture gave some very good insight onto programming as a whole. And talked about topics
like debugging, tools, profiling. Something that many CS courses don't pay attention to.

## Tools

1. Make - Great tool for automating shell commands.
2. Dot files - Great way to draw graphs, UML and other structures very much needed in CSE.
3. Hammerspoon - Great tool to automate MacOS.
