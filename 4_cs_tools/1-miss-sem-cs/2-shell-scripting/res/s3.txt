"Et tu, Brute?"

"Be great in act, as you have been in thought."

"For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; lillies that fester, smell far worse than weeds."

"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."

"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this and this gives life to thee."
