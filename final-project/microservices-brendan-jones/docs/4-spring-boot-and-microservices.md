# Why Spring Boot?
- Simplicity
    - Automatic cofiguration: manually configure only when needed
    - No need for web.xml, applicationContext.xml unless desired

- @Configuration preferred over XML

- Directly embed application server (Tomcat)

Spring : Loosely coupled components
Microservices : Loosely coupled services
