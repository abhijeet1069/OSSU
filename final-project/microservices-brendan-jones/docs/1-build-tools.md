## UI
    HTML/XHTML - Good for markup, but not dynamic
    Servlet - Java program that writes HTML but, hard to update HTML
    JSP - Mixes UI and code
    ->JSF - HTML-ish page with tag extensions. Works well with JavaBeans/POJO

## Object Instantiation
    ->Spring - Annotation based or XML based, good integration with transaction framework, AOP
    CDI - J2EE implementation of dependency injection.

    PolyMorphism - variable type tells you what you are allowed to call; object types tells you what
                        will happen.
