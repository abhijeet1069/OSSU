C is the language of choice for system-level programming, and there is a huge 
installed base of application-level programs as well. However, it is not perfect 
for all programmers and all situations. C pointers are a common source of confusion 
and programming errors. C also lacks explicit support for useful abstractions such as 
classes, objects, and exceptions. Newer languages such as C++ and Java address these 
issues for application-level programs.

A file is a sequence of bytes, nothing more and nothing less. Every I/O device,
including disks, keyboards, displays, and even networks, is modeled as a file. All
input and output in the system is performed by reading and writing files, using a
small set of system calls known as Unix I/O.
