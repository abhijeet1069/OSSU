# Secure Programming Design Principles

## Least Priviledge

A subject should be given only those privileges necessary to complete its task.

## Fail Safe Defaults

Make program fail safe. Even if program fails, default action is to deny access.

## Economy of Mechanism

Keep it as simple as possible.

## Complete Mediation

Check every access.

## Open Design

Security should not only depend on secrecy of design or implementation. Even if your design is public
the system is safe.

## Separation of Priviledge

Requires multiple conditions to grant priviledge.

## Least Common Mechanism

Mechanism should not be shared.

## Least Astonishment

Security mechanism should be designed so users understand why the mechanism works the way it does, and using
mechanism is simple.
