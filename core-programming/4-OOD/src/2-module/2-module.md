# OOP Design Principles

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the idea of simplifying a concept in the problem domain to its essentials within some context.
It allows one to better understand the concept by breaking it down into simplified description that ignores
irrelevant details.

### Rule of Least Astonishment

The abstraction has to capture essential attributes and behavior for a concept with no surprises and no
defintions that fall beyond its scope.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation forms a self-contained object by bundling the data and functions it requires to work,
exposes an interface whereby other objects can access and use it, and restricts access to certain
inside details.
Encapsulation helps with data-integrity, and store sensetive information, where class can behave like black-boxes.

## Decomposition

Decomposition is taking a whole thing a whole thing and dividing it up into different parts.

## Generalisation

Don't Repeat Yourself (D.R.Y).
