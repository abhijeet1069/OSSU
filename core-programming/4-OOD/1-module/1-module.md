# Expressing requirements:

## User Stories
Once a requirement is elicited, it needs to be expressed in some form. One technique for expressing
a requirement is called a user story. A user story is simply a requirement, often from the
perspective of an end-user, which is stated in natural language. You may have seen Sam using one
of these in the previous video. A user story looks like this:

As a ______, I want to ______ so that ______.
As an online shopper, I want to add an item to my shopping cart, so that I can purchase it.
